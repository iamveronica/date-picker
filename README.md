date picker
===========

This is an iOS date picker app that I created in 2012 for a college class. Utilized the Xcode IDE, Cocoa Touch framework, and Objective-C.

Demonstrates the relationship of passing data between view pages in an iOS app.

Select the date and time.

Tap "Second View" to see the date and time selected.

Tap "Third View" to see the blue view page.

tap "Return" or "Home" to view the first page.
